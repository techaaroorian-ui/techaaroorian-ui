# Independent package versioning

TechAaroorian UI is a collection, not one synchronized release. Aar Loom and Contextual Empty each have their own package version and changelog. The private docs app is not published. Displayed versions come from package manifests.

## Contract and stability

The checkout contains independently versioned alpha packages. The docs versioning page reads all eight manifests directly, including Pan & Zoom and Share State. These are manifest versions, not proof of publication. Do not overwrite a published version.

SemVer treats 0.y.z as initial development: https://semver.org/.

Our pre-1.0 convention is **patch** for compatible additions and fixes, **minor** for breaking changes. Once a package reaches 1.0, use patch for compatible fixes, minor for compatible features, and major for breaking changes. A breaking change must include migration notes.

Aar Loom's public contract includes documented classes, attributes, tokens, exported CSS paths, and interaction/accessibility behavior. Removing tokens, changing component anatomy, or altering theme scope can be breaking even if there is no JavaScript API. Contextual Empty's contract includes exports, props, callbacks, DOM/state attributes, and its documented CSS hooks.

## Changesets workflow

1. Run `npm run changeset` after changing a public package. Select affected packages and write a consumer-facing summary. Avoid package bumps for docs-only changes.
2. Inspect the pending plan with `npm run changeset:status`. Pending records should represent actual changes, not scheduled future features.
3. Apply the plan with `npm run version:packages`. This updates manifests, changelogs, and package-lock.json without publishing.
4. Build, test, inspect package contents, and review the version diff with `npm run release:check`.
5. Commit the release diff. Publish deliberately with `npm run release` or the manual release workflow. Changesets skips versions already in the registry and creates package-specific release tags when it publishes.

Changesets usage: https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md.

The current checkout is in Changesets prerelease mode with the alpha tag. For a new preview channel use `npm exec changeset pre enter alpha`, add changesets, and version normally; publish on the alpha dist-tag. Exit with `npm exec changeset pre exit` when preparing the stable release. Preview preparation must also be reviewed; it does not happen automatically on every merge.

After applying changesets, use `npm run release:ready` to inspect the prepared versions and channel. `changeset:status` is for pending records; with Changesets 3 it can report missing records after a plan has been consumed while the branch still differs from main. The manual publish workflow uses release:ready instead and refuses unversioned pending records.

## Release checks

`npm run release:check` builds and tests the prepared manifests, builds/lints documentation, and runs `npm run test:packed`. The packed-consumer check creates local tarballs under `.cache/packed-consumer`, verifies exported files and release metadata, and exercises JavaScript, React adapter, CommonJS, and CSS entry points from those payloads. It uses this checkout's installed React peers; it is not a fresh registry-install test. Verify a clean installation from npm after publication.

Build all eight public packages and docs, run component and core behavior tests and docs lint, and inspect dry-run package contents. Run browser smoke checks with the docs server for UI/theme and React adapter changes, including dialog focus/dismissal and picker keyboard interaction. Verify the CSS package has no runtime icon dependency and the headless cores import without React. Inspect the tarballs before publishing; a successful build is not proof that the right files are included.

No automatic publish on pushes to main. The workflow is manual and defaults to dry-run. Registry credentials are required only for publication. This task configures release tooling; it does not publish, create release tags, or claim that local versions are released.
